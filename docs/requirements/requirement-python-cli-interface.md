**Area**: python
**Key**: `requirement-python-cli-interface`
**Philosophy**: CIAO **v2.10.2** / CIAO-Lite (Caution • Intentional • Anti-fragile • Over-engineered / Over-protect)

## 1. Purpose

Define the official command-line entry points, empty-argv behavior, and typed verbs for the VideoJoin Python package.

The text-menu picture is `requirement-python-tui`. Join steps and formats are `requirement-domain-videojoin`. The about page is `requirement-python-about`. The domain sentence stays on the domain file. The logger construct is `requirement-python-cli-logging`. Class homes are `requirement-python-oop`. Concat order is `requirement-video-ffmpeg-pipeline`.

`def main` writes `ChronicleLogger(...)` and then constructs `Cli`. The argument parser runs after that construct and after the debug block. The running `src/VideoJoin/cli.py` still starts the prompt session. The allowed end state is this file. This pass does not change `src/`.

### 1.1 Human-facing

**In one sentence:** `video-join` with no words opens the numbered menu on a terminal, and with no terminal it prints help and stops.

| Box | Meaning | Example |
|-----|---------|---------|
| You / this login | Person at the keyboard or in a script | `video-join` or `video-join join` |
| The other role | The menu picture and the join facts | `requirement-python-tui`, `requirement-domain-videojoin` |
| Not this file | How the frame is drawn, and how FFmpeg concatenates | TUI and pipeline requirements |

| Includes | Excludes |
|----------|----------|
| Console script, module entry, typed verbs, empty-argv menu or help | A shell installer on empty argv. File-operand flags for join |
| `join` and `list-videos` as typed verbs, also owned by the domain file | A numbered row for `list-videos` or `help` |
| Pip verbs `version-check`, `self-update`, `self-install`, `self-uninstall`, also owned by the text menu | `sudo` pip, or a downloaded script piped into a shell |

| Surface | What you open | What for |
|---------|---------------|----------|
| `video-join` on a terminal | Front board | Menu. Does not start the join questions |
| `video-join` with no terminal | Help text | Exit 0 |
| `video-join join` on a terminal | Join questions | First index, second index, output name |
| `video-join help` | Help text | Verb list. Does not draw the menu |

| You do… | What it means | What you type |
|---------|---------------|---------------|
| Start on a terminal | The front board opens. Pip does not run. | `video-join` |
| Start in a script | Help text, exit 0. | `video-join` |
| Join two videos | On a terminal, the questions use the bottom box. With no terminal, the program stops and tells you to use a terminal. | `video-join join` |
| List files | Names in this folder. Nothing is joined. | `video-join list-videos` |
| Check or change the install | Pip runs only when you ask. Empty argv does not. | `video-join version-check` |

## 2. Core Rules (Mandatory)

### 2.1 Entry points

1. **MUST** expose a console script entry named `video-join` pointing at `VideoJoin.cli:main` (declared in packaging SSOT).
2. **MUST** support module execution: `python -m VideoJoin`.
3. **MUST** keep `def main` in `src/VideoJoin/cli.py` as the single runtime entry. `main` writes `ChronicleLogger(...)` before it constructs `Cli` (`requirement-python-cli-logging`, `requirement-python-oop`).
4. **MUST NOT** require root or sudo to run the CLI.

### 2.2 Empty argv

5. On a terminal, bare invocation (`video-join` with no args, or `python -m VideoJoin` with no args) **MUST** open the front board in `requirement-python-tui`. It **MUST NOT** start the join questions. It **MUST NOT** run pip.
6. When stdout is not a terminal, bare invocation **MUST** print help and return 0. It **MUST NOT** draw the text screen and **MUST NOT** wait.
7. **MUST NOT** default empty argv to a shell-channel install or to self-update.

### 2.3 Typed verbs

8. `ArgumentParser.parse_args` **MUST** run after `ChronicleLogger(...)` and after the debug block.
9. The typed verbs are `help`, `version`, `about`, `hello`, `self-install`, `version-check`, `self-update`, and `self-uninstall`. Each one is operational. **MUST NOT** add a verb whose only purpose is a test. **MUST NOT** add `join` or `list-videos`. `language` is not a typed verb. Menu row 4 owns it (`requirement-python-cli-language`). **MUST NOT** add `language` to `PRODUCT_VERBS`.
10. **MUST NOT** invent file-operand flags. **MUST NOT** scan the working directory for media files.
11. On a terminal, `hello` **MUST NOT** draw the text screen. `about` **MUST** open the about page.
12. With no terminal, `about` **MUST** print the about page and return 0. It does not draw the text screen. `hello` **MUST** print the welcome line and return 0.
13. `help` and `hello` **MUST NOT** draw the text screen. `help` returns 0. `hello` prints `Welcome to VideoJoin <version>.` using `__version__` and returns 0. It does not print a next-step line. Menu row 1 shows that same line.
14. `version` **MUST** print `__version__` and **MUST NOT** call pip and **MUST NOT** draw the text screen.
15. `version-check`, `self-update`, `self-install`, and `self-uninstall` **MUST NOT** open the text screen. The commands are:

| Verb | Command |
|------|---------|
| `version-check` | `python -m pip index versions VideoJoin` |
| `self-update` | `python -m pip install --upgrade VideoJoin` |
| `self-install` | `python -m pip install VideoJoin` |
| `self-uninstall` | `python -m pip uninstall -y VideoJoin` only when `--force` is also present |

`self-uninstall` without `--force` **MUST** print the next step and return non-zero. The package stays installed. These commands **MUST NOT** use `sudo` and **MUST NOT** use `curl`. Empty argv **MUST NOT** run `self-install` or `self-update`.

Every typed verb is named again by its topic owner. Help text is not that second mention.

| Verb | Second mention |
|------|----------------|
| `help`, `hello`, `version` | This file for `help` and `hello`. `version` is also row 82 on `requirement-python-tui` |
| `about` | `requirement-python-about` and row 83. The domain sentence stays on pillar D of `requirement-domain-videojoin` |
| `join`, `list-videos` | `requirement-domain-videojoin` |
| `self-install`, `version-check`, `self-update`, `self-uninstall` | Rows 84–87 on `requirement-python-tui` |

`language` is not in this table. The second mention of that ban is `requirement-python-cli-language`.

Complete invocation samples:

```text
video-join
video-join help
video-join hello
video-join version
video-join about
video-join join
video-join list-videos
video-join self-install
video-join version-check
video-join self-update
video-join self-uninstall --force
python -m VideoJoin
```

### 2.4 Join questions

These rules are the `join` verb. The text screen draws them (`requirement-python-tui`). The domain file owns the step catalog. They are not what empty argv does.

16. **MUST** scan the current working directory for eligible video files (domain format set).
17. **MUST** list discoverable videos with 1-based indices, sorted case-insensitively by name.
18. When fewer than two eligible videos are found, **MUST** fail closed with a clear message and **MUST NOT** run FFmpeg. A direct `video-join join` exits non-zero. An already open front board stays open.
19. **MUST** ask for the first video index, then the second index from the remaining set (first choice excluded).
20. **MUST** ask again on a non-numeric or out-of-range selection. **MUST NOT** proceed with an invalid index.
21. **MUST** ask for the output filename. Empty means the documented default.
22. **MUST** show the chosen pair and the output path before running FFmpeg.
23. **MUST** show a clear success or failure outcome after the join attempt.

There is no folder question. Esc on the text screen returns to the front board and does not join.

### 2.5 Flags

24. The parser accepts the verbs in rule 9. `help` is also available as `--help`.
25. This product does not claim `--json`. **MUST NOT** add it in this file.
26. **MUST NOT** add `--debug`. Debug status is the environment gate on `requirement-python-cli-logging`.
27. **MUST NOT** add file-operand flags for the two inputs or the output.

### 2.6 Output behavior

28. Join progress and failures **MUST** be visible to the operator. On the text screen they are drawn in the menu region. Off the text screen they are console lines.
29. Durable status **MUST** go through ChronicleLogger once `main` has constructed it (`requirement-python-cli-logging`). The console failure sentence remains required.
30. **MUST NOT** mix a machine-only JSON mode into the session. This product does not claim `--json`.

### 2.7 FFmpeg gate

31. The front board **MUST** be allowed to open when `ffmpeg` is missing.
32. `join` **MUST** fail closed with an actionable message when `ffmpeg` is missing, before FFmpeg is spawned (`requirement-runtime-prerequisites`).
33. The about page names FFmpeg on the static runtime-tools line (`requirement-python-about`). It does not probe `PATH` and it does not install FFmpeg. `join` still fails closed when `ffmpeg` is missing.

### 2.8 Implementation Notes (this project)

| Item | Value |
|------|--------|
| **Console script** | `video-join = VideoJoin.cli:main` |
| **Module entry** | `src/VideoJoin/__main__.py` → `main()` |
| **CLI module** | `src/VideoJoin/cli.py` defines `Cli` and `def main` in the allowed end state |
| **Empty argv, terminal** | Front board. No join questions. No pip |
| **Empty argv, no terminal** | Help text. Return 0 |
| **Parser** | After ChronicleLogger and the debug block |
| **Quiet / JSON** | Text screen sets `is_quiet=True` on the logger construct. No `--json` |
| **Privilege** | user-level only |
| **Running tree** | `cli.py` still calls `ensure_ffmpeg()` and then the prompt session. That is not the allowed end state |
| **Product version** | `1.0.5` |
| **User docs** | Root `README.md` Usage must match this contract when the behavior ships. This pass does not edit that README |

### 2.9 Why This Requirement Exists (CIAO)

- **Principle 2 – Intentional**: Entry, empty argv, and each typed verb are explicit.
- **Principle 16 – Interactive awareness**: A terminal opens the menu. No terminal prints help and returns 0.
- **Principle 5 – SSOT**: Verb names live here and on the topic owner. The picture lives on the TUI requirement.
- **Principle 10 – Least privilege**: Pip verbs do not use sudo.

## Under command line for normal user only

On Termux, Git Bash, Windows cmd, or the same class, the person runs `video-join` as the normal user. **This requirement:** do not use administrator privilege, `sudo`, `apt`, or a dedicated system user to start the program or to run the pip verbs. Do not pipe a downloaded script into a shell. Type 1 and Type 2 are unused on Termux, Git Bash, and Windows cmd. Git Bash and Windows cmd do not call Termux `pkg`.

## 3. Design Principles (CIAO / CIAO-Lite)

- **Caution:** Fewer than two videos does not encode. Invalid index asks again. Join with no terminal exits non-zero.
- **Intentional:** Empty argv is the menu on a terminal and help off a terminal.
- **Anti-fragile:** Module entry and the console script both call `main`.
- **Over-protect:** Empty argv does not install, update, or start the join questions.

## 4. Protection Rule (Sacred)

**Future AI assistants, Grok, or maintainers MUST NOT**:

1. Change empty argv into a shell-channel install.
2. Make empty argv start the join questions or run pip.
3. Make empty argv off a terminal exit non-zero. That path prints help and returns 0.
4. Remove the console script or the module entry without a packaging and docs update.
5. Require root to run a normal join.
6. Allow the same file as both inputs without a domain-law change.
7. Add file-operand flags, `--json`, or `--debug` in this file.
8. Treat help text as the second mention of a verb.
9. Add `language` as an argv verb. Row 4 is the menu language.

**Violating this rule is a critical CLI regression.**

## 5. Acceptance criteria

| ID | Criterion |
|----|-----------|
| AC-1 | `video-join` entry declared in packaging |
| AC-2 | `python -m VideoJoin` reaches `main` |
| AC-3 | Empty argv on a terminal opens the front board and does not join and does not run pip |
| AC-4 | Empty argv with no terminal prints help and returns 0 |
| AC-5 | Direct `join` with no terminal exits non-zero |
| AC-6 | Fewer than two videos does not encode. An invalid index asks again |
| AC-7 | Pip verbs match the command table and do not use sudo or curl |
